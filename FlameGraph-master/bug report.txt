159 LM - Thanks for reporting this. I'll take a look at it. Just curious, where is this static code checker? Anywhere I can play with it as well? Thanks

2025 LM - Mostly they are on click & don't really affect User Interface. May be from some we could really win, but for some it is better to leave the codebase clear & better maintainable

WebSMS : https://code.google.com/p/websmsdroid
801 LM - well, you are totally right. the thing is, websms was my first android app and it is a port from j2me. it has a very old code base and is quite odd in many cases. :x if i would write the app from scratch, i would do most of the things very different. i once started to refactor the code. but in the end, i gave up. there were other important things to do. and the user base is shrinking. just because sms usage is shrinking globally. if you want to make the app better in any case. just fork it on github and let me merge your changes. i'd be very thankful. :)
